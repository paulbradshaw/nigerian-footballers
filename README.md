# Data related to an investigation into Nigerian football agents

In 2015 I was involved in an investigation into Nigerian football agents with Yemisi Akinbobola and Ogechi Ekeanyanwu: *[Follow the money: Who extracts the value of Nigerian footballers?](http://www.iq4news.com/follow-the-money/)*. It [won the CNN MultiChoice award](https://vimeo.com/187993647) for sport reporting.

This repo contains some of the data used in the investigation (other datasets are too large). You can [read about the background to the investigation and how it was done here](http://www.iq4news.com/how-we-did-it/).
